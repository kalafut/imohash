# imohash

imohash is a fast, constant-time hashing library for Go. It uses file size and
sampling to calculate hashes quickly, regardless of file size.

[imosum](https://github.com/kalafut/imohash/blob/master/cmd/imosum/main.go) is
a sample application to hash files from the command line, similar to md5sum.

imohash is also available as [a Python library](https://github.com/kalafut/py-imohash) and as part of the [hash4j Java library](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/hash4j).

## Installation

`go get github.com/kalafut/imohash/...`

The API is described in the [package documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/kalafut/imohash).

## Uses

Because imohash only reads a small portion of a file's data, it is very fast and
well suited to file synchronization and deduplication, especially over a fairly
slow network. A need to manage media (photos and video) over Wi-Fi between a NAS
and multiple family computers is how the library was born.

If you just need to check whether two files are the same, and understand the
limitations that sampling imposes (see below), imohash may be a good fit.

## Misuses

Because imohash only reads a small portion of a file's data, it is not suitable
for:

- file verification or integrity monitoring
- cases where fixed-size files are manipulated
- anything cryptographic

## Design

(Note: a more precise description is provided in the
[algorithm description](https://github.com/kalafut/imohash/blob/master/algorithm.md).)

imohash works by hashing small chunks of data from the beginning, middle and
end of a file. It also incorporates the file size into the final 128-bit hash.
This approach is based on a few assumptions which will vary by application.
First, file size alone *tends*<sup>1</sup> to be a pretty good differentiator, especially
as file size increases. And when people do things to files (such as editing
photos), size tends to change. So size is used directly in the hash, and **any
files that have different sizes will have different hashes**.

Size is an effective differentiator but isn't sufficient. It can show that two
files aren't the same, but to increase confidence that like-size files are the
same, a few segments are hashed using
[murmur3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), a fast and effective
hashing algorithm.  By default, 16K chunks from the beginning, middle and end of
the file are used.  The ends of files often contain metadata which is more prone
to changing without affecting file size. The middle is for good measure. The
sample size can be changed for your application.

<sup>1</sup> Try `du -a . | sort -nr | less` on a sample of your files to check this assertion.

### Small file exemption
Small files are more likely to collide on size than large ones. They're also
probably more likely to change in subtle ways that sampling will miss (e.g.
editing a large text file). For this reason, imohash will simply hash the entire
file if it is less than 128K. This parameter is also configurable.

## Performance
The standard hash performance metrics make no sense for imohash since it's only
reading a limited set of the data. That said, the real-world performance is
very good. If you are working with large files and/or a slow network,
expect huge speedups. (**spoiler**: reading 48K is quicker than reading 500MB.)

* The "sparseFingerprints" used in [TMSU](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU) gave me
some confidence in this approach to hashing.
* The [twmb/mumur3](https://github.com/twmb/murmur3) library that does
all of the heavy lifting.
